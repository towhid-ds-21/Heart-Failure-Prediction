# Heart-Failure-Prediction
Cardiovascular disorders (CVDs) are the number one cause of death worldwide, claiming an estimated 17.9 million lives per year, comprising 31 percent of all deaths in the world. Heart loss is a chronic occurrence triggered by CVDs and there are 12 attributes in the dataset that can be used to predict heart disease mortality. Many chronic disorders may be avoided by applying population-wide approaches to tackle behavioral risk factors such as cigarette consumption, poor nutrition and obesity, physical inactivity, and excessive alcohol usage. We tried to predict the heart failure rate by doing exploratory data analysis.
